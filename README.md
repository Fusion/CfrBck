# cfrbck

Not an actual project so far. It may not ever become one.

This is an attempt at writing a backup tool, dedupping while maintaining 
full and incremental backups.

This is meant for a specific use case: backing up a containers host.

## Installation

1. git checkout
2. install shards. Then run 'shards' for dependencies.

## Usage

    cfrbck -h

## Development

My first crystal project and I picked one that would require playing with 
slices etc. Silly me. Also, no functional programming-ness so far so 
apologies for the myriad of side effects.
